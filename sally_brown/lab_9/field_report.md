The Mapbox map was better than the slippy map because it has a geo-locate feature. I personally prefer the styling of my qgis map though, so I like to use the Avenza map which has my style and the geo-locate feature. I also preferred to use the Avenza Map because it provided an easier user interface while also providing the same information as the Mapbox and Slippy map.

The most accurate map was the OSM data, though the OSM and the base map of the Mapbox style were about the same.  The trail data received from the park(lab 6) was very inaccurate. On mapping all of the trails in the park the OSM data was missing a trail and also was not labeled with the correct names of the trails.
